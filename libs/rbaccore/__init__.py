"""Shared RBAC core — the single source of truth for role semantics.

Both api-gateway (enforcement) and identity-service (seed) import this, so the
built-in role permission docs and the merge/check logic exist in exactly ONE
place. Stdlib-only and pure (except nothing) so tests load it directly.

Permission document shape (per role, v2):
    {
      "all": bool,                         # superadmin-style: allow everything
      "flags": ["reveal", ...],            # capability flags (credential reveal, ...)
      "perms": {"<segment>": ["GET","POST","PUT","PATCH","DELETE"] | ["*"], ...}
    }

Roles answer CAPABILITY (which feature/verb). Resource access (which host, which
credential) is a SEPARATE mandatory gate in za_authorizations — see bypasses_authz.

v3 (4-role rewrite): exactly 4 roles — superadmin, admin, support, user — each
mapped to real backend segments (services/api-gateway/app/proxy.py SERVICE_ROUTES
is the authoritative segment list; every real segment appears in a group below,
nothing silently falls through to default-deny by omission). "playbook-run" is a
pseudo-segment: not a real routed segment, only meaningful via the special-case
check in services/api-gateway/app/rbac.py::is_authorized() that separates
"run an existing playbook" from "create/edit a playbook template" — both are
POST on the same real `job-templates` segment, so segment+method alone can't
tell them apart.
