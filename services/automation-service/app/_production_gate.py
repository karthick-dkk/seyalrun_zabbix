"""Production-host gating (PCI DSS Phase D) — checks inventory-service for any
target host tagged is_production, so a dispatch path can force the approval
flow regardless of the template's own requires_approval setting. Shared by
every entry point that creates a ZAJobRun directly (job_templates.py's manual
run, scheduler.py's cron dispatch, internal.py's Zabbix-triggered webhook) so
"production is always gated" holds regardless of trigger mechanism — a single
copy in job_templates.py only covered the manual-run path.

Not wired into chain.py's per-step dispatch: a chain step is awaited
synchronously as part of one continuous run (the chain loop blocks on each
step's result before starting the next), so a step landing in
pending_approval would leave the whole chain hanging indefinitely with
nothing to resume it — a real gap, but one that needs its own suspend/resume
design for chains rather than reusing this fire-and-forget check.
